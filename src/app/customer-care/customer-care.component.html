        <p class="para">Customer service is the provision of service to customers before, during, and after a purchase. The perception of success of such interactions is dependent on employees "who can adjust themselves to the personality of the guest".[1] Customer service concerns the priority an organization assigns to customer service relative to components such as product innovation and pricing. In this sense, an organization that values good customer service may spend more money in training employees than the average organization or may proactively interview customers for feedback.

            From the point of view of an overall sales process engineering effort, customer service plays an important role in an organization's ability to generate income and revenue.[2] One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization.Customer support is a range of customer services to assist customers in making cost-effective and correct use of a product.[4] It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.[4] These services even may be done at the customer's side where he/she uses the product or service. In this case, it is called "at home customer services" or " at home customer support."

            Regarding technology, products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed technical support.</p>
